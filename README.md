# A Global Instruction Preamble for Indicator Extraction using Google Gemini Pro
## Authors: Kristin Hoelting, Amber Himes-Cornell, Lucy Bowser, Rina Hauptfeld, Eric Gross
> This GIP is in development. Note: FAO’s conceptual categories (GIP Section 13.0) are redacted from this version, but will be added to a future GIP version once final adjustments to the categories have been completed.

This Global Instruction Preamble (GIP) contains conceptual guidelines and data extraction rules that enable Google Gemini Pro to extract indicators from PDF articles and populate a desired set of attributes of each indicator. The specific guidelines and rules contained in this version of the GIP are tailored to support a UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) scoping review of social indicators in use for fisheries and aquaculture management globally. The FAO scoping review is focused on identifying and characterizing the attributes of social indicators used globally in fisheries and aquaculture management. The FAO Scoping Review Protocol registration can be viewed on OSF at [URL to be inserted once protocol is registered on OSF website]. Outputs from Gemini, guided by this GIP, are being used to validate scoping review data extracted by the human team.

This GIP could be adjusted or used as is to carry out indicator extraction for other applications.

This GitHub page contains the full GIP document and a set of supporting materials used to contextualize prompts and/or carry out state refreshes at several points throughout the process:

#Author contributions:
* Kristin Hoelting was solely responsible for translating the FAO scoping review conceptual guidelines and data extraction protocol into the form of this GIP, which enables definitions and rules to be ingested and used by Google Gemini Pro. She worked iteratively with Gemini to develop instructions and prompts that enable Gemini to identify indicators and populating desired indicator attributes. While at FAO, Hoelting led the development of the conceptual guidelines and data extraction protocol that serve as the basis for this GIP.
* Amber Himes-Cornell served as the overall project coordinator for FAO’s scoping review, including overseeing the development of the conceptual guidelines and data extraction protocol that serve as the basis for this GIP.
* Lucy Bowser assisted with development of the conceptual guidelines and data extraction protocol that serve as the basis for this GIP.
* Rina Hauptfeld assisted with development of the conceptual guidelines and data extraction protocol that serve as the basis for this GIP.
* Eric Gross provided AI mentorship support to Kristin Hoelting.
