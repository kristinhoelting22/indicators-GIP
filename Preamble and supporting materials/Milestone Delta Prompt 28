# **14.0 Relationships Within and Between Indicators**

I am interested to track several types of conceptual relationships that exist both within the description of a single indicator, and between two distinct indicators included in AI’s list of relevant indicators.

* **Within-Indicator Relationships**: The types of within-indicator relationships of interest include:

    * **Conceptual Proxy**: The **primary variable concept** is used as a proxy for the **indicator topic**. Definitions are provided in section [14.1.1 Conceptual Elements within a Single Indicator](#1411-conceptual-elements-within-a-single-indicator), and the protocol for identifying presence or absence of a conceptual proxy is provided in section [14.1.3 Conceptual proxy](#1413-conceptual-proxy).
    * **Secondary Variable Concepts**: After identifying the **primary variable concept**, i.e., the primary conceptual assessment target of the variable, there may be additional, **secondary variable concept(s)** described in the **indicator definition** and/or **variable assessment details**. The conceptual sub-category of these secondary concepts must also be recorded in Table 3 following definitions provided in section [14.1.1 Conceptual Elements within a Single Indicator](#1411-conceptual-elements-within-a-single-indicator) and protocols outlined in section [14.1.2 Protocols for Identifying Conceptual Components Within Indicators](#1412-protocols-for-identifying-conceptual-components-within-indicators].

* **Between-Indicator Relationships**: The types of between-indicator relationships of interest include:

    * **Sub-variables and Outcome Variables**: The role of some indicators as constitutive **sub-variables** used to calculate other **outcome variable** indicators (see section [14.2 Sub-variables and Outcome Variables](#142-sub-variables-and-outcome-variables)
    * **Relating variables and Target Variables**: The role of one indicator (X) as a **relating variable** and another indicator (Y) as a **target variable**. The terms relating variable and target variable are broad terms used to capture concepts such as predictor and response variables, independent and dependent variables, as well as types of X-Y relationships that are not directional or not statistically explored. Definitions of types of X-Y relationships are provided in section [14.3 X-Y relationship types](#143-x-y-relationship-types).

## **14.1 Within-Indicator Conceptual Relationships**

### **14.1.1 Conceptual Elements within a Single Indicator**
If all three **basic variable components** are reported in the study (Indicator Name, Indicator Definition, and Variable Assessment Details), as described in section [2.0 Instructions for Identifying Relevant Indicators](#20-instructions-for-identifying-relevant-indicators), it will be possible to discern all of the **conceptual elements** for the indicator. If the Variable Assessment Details are not provided in the study, it will only be possible to identify the Indicator Topic. The full set of conceptual elements are as follows:

| Conceptual Component | Definition | Protocol Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Indicator topic** | The **conceptual representation target** (the goal concept). Always present. [MANDATE for Sub-variables]: For any indicator acting as a $\mathbf{Sub-variable}$ to a **Composite index** (Code 4 in Table 4) or an **Other derived outcome** (Code 5 in Table 4), the Indicator Topic MUST be conceptually identical to the Primary Variable Concept unless the original source text explicitly states that the sub-variable is used as a proxy for an external concept. The only exception is for inputs to Latent Constructs (Code 7 in Table 4), where the IT of the sub-variable defaults to the IT of the Latent Construct. The Indicator topic is always present. | Protocol 14.1.2.1 |
| **Primary Variable Concept** | The **primary conceptual assessment target** (the concept being directly assessed). Present if Variable Assessment Details are available. | Protocol 14.1.2.4 |
| **Specifying Secondary Variable Concept** | A **more specific conceptual component** used to detail a general Primary Variable Concept. | Protocol 14.1.2.5 |
| **Equation Secondary Variable Concept** | A **conceptual sub-variable** implied by the indicator's mathematical structure or indicator definition but not fully described in the study as a stand-alone sub-variable. | Protocol 14.1.2.6 |
| **Predictor Secondary Variable Concept** | A **conceptual element described as influencing or correlating** with the Indicator Topic/Primary Variable Concept within the indicator's definition.| Protocol 14.1.2.7 |

### **14.1.2 Protocols for Identifying Conceptual Components Within Indicators**

#### **14.1.2.1 Format Constraint: Multiplicity of Secondary Concepts**: The following rule applies to all subsequent protocols having to do with identification of **Secondary Variable Concepts** (Protocols 14.1.2.6, 14.1.2.7, and 14.1.2.8):

**Multiplicity Format Constraint**: If an indicator description yields more than one secondary variable concept (Specifying, Equation, or Predictor), the corresponding conceptual sub-categories and definition matches reported in Table 3 **must be separated by a semi-colon (;) for each distinct entry.** (Example: "Material benefits; Food security and consumption").

#### **14.1.2.2 Protocol for Indicator Topic Assignment for Sub-variables**: The $\mathbf{Indicator \ Topic}$ assignment for any indicator that also serves as a $\mathbf{Sub-variable}$ of a complex aggregate (Code 4, 5) must follow this precedence: 1. **Default Rule**: The Indicator Topic must be conceptually identical to the $\mathbf{Primary \ Variable \ Concept}$ (i.e., the sub-variable is its own topic). This results in Proxy Absent (n/a). 2. **Explicit Proxy Exception**: Override the default rule only if the source text explicitly names the sub-variable (X) as a measure of a distinct, high-level concept (Z) not equal to the Primary Variable Concept. (Resulting in Proxy Present (Yes)).

#### **14.1.2.3 Protocol for Latent Construct Sub-variables (Code 7 Exception)**: If the indicator acts as a $\mathbf{Sub-variable}$ feeding into a $\mathbf{Latent \ Construct \ (Code \ 7)}$ output, the **Indicator Topic** $\mathbf{MUST}$ be the name/concept of the Latent Construct itself. This reflects the conceptualization that the sub-variable is an observable manifestation of the latent construct, thereby acting as a proxy for it (resulting in Proxy Present (Yes) if categories are distinct, or Proxy Absent (n/a) if the construct name happens to map to the same category).

#### **14.1.2.4 Protocol for Identifying Indicator Topic**
The Indicator Topic is the conceptual representation target of the indicator and is always present. It must be discerned based on a comprehensive review of all available basic indicator components (Indicator Name, Indicator Definition, and/or Variable Assessment Details).

* **Discretion Rule**: If only one basic indicator component is available, the indicator topic must be discerned based solely on that one component

#### 14.1.2.5 Protocol for Identifying the Primary Variable Concept**
The Primary Variable Concept is the primary conceptual assessment target of the indicator. Its identification is strictly conditional on the study providing details on how the variable was assessed.

* **Condition**: This element is possible to discern and always present if and only if Variable Assessment Details are provided for the indicator in the source text.
* **Discernment**: The Primary Variable Concept must match the main concept of the indicator that is directly being measured or assessed.

#### **14.1.2.6 Protocol for Identifying a Specifying Secondary Variable Concept**

* **Trigger**: Indicator definition or Variable Assessment Details are present.
* **Step 1 (Check Scope)**: Does the variable description contain both a general conceptual component and a specific conceptual component?
* **Step 2 (Check Conceptual Match)**: Do the general and specific components match to distinct conceptual sub-categories?
* **Step 3 (Execution)**: If the condition in Step 2 is Yes, the AI must report the following information in Table 3:

    a. **Secondary variable concept type**: Begin each entry with the type of secondary variable element, followed by colon space (": "), (e.g., "Specifying: ").
    b. **Secondary Concept**: Report the specifying concept (e.g., "Catching power of gear"), followed by comma space (", "). For example, if an indicator has the **primary variable concept** of "Catching power", and the indicator definition and/or variable assessment details clarify that the indicator is specifically about a particular aspect or type of catching power, e.g., catching power of the gear (as opposed to the vessel itself or the number of crew), AI should recognize the presence of a more specific concept beyond catching power, and enter the more specific concept "Catching power of harvest gear, ".
    c. **Associated Sub-category**: Report the conceptual sub-category that best matches the implied concept (e.g., "Harvest gear"). (Reference definitions in section [13.3 Sub-category definitions](#133-sub-category-definitions)).
    d. **Multiplicity**: If several specifying conceptual elements are implied by the definition and/or variable assessment details, separate individual entries using a semi-colon and space ("; "). If other types of secondary variable concepts are also listed, these must also be separated by a semi-colon and space ("; ").

#### **14.1.2.7 Protocol for Identifying an Equation Secondary Variable Concept**

* **Trigger**: The **indicator definition** and/or **Variable Assessment Details** are present.
* **Step 1a (Check Calculation Logic)**: Does the variable assessment description suggest conceptual elements that were used to calculate or structurally define the Indicator Topic?
* **Step 1b (Mandate for Code 11 Constitutive Elements)**: For any indicator whose Outcome Type is Categorical Outcome (Code 11), the conceptual characteristics/sub-variables that define the grouping (e.g., economic capacity, regulatory environment, geographic location) MUST be treated as Equation Secondary Variable Concepts and documented following Step 2, even if no arithmetic calculation is present.
* **Step 2 (Execution)**: If the condition in **Step 1a is Yes** OR if the mandate in **Step 1b applies**, the AI must report the following information in Table 3:

    a. **Secondary variable concept type**: Begin each entry with the type of secondary variable element, followed by colon space (": "), (e.g., "Equation: ").
    b. **Secondary Concept**: Report the concept being structurally implied (e.g., "Days at sea"), followed by comma space (", "). For example, if an indicator with the **indicator topic** "Fishing effort", and the indicator definition and/or variable assessment details suggest that one of the elements of the calculation involved the number of days at sea, AI should recognize this as an equation secondary variable element that is structurally constitutive of the indicator topic, and enter "Days at sea, ".
    c. **Associated Sub-category**: Report the conceptual sub-category that best matches the implied concept (e.g., "Harvest practices"). (Reference definitions in section [13.3 Sub-category definitions](#133-sub-category-definitions)).
    d. **Multiplicity**: If several equation conceptual elements are implied by the definition and/or variable assessment details, separate individual entries using a semi-colon and space ("; "). If other types of secondary variable concepts are also listed, these must also be separated by a semi-colon and space ("; ").

#### **14.1.2.8 Protocol for Identifying a Predictor Secondary Variable Concept**

* **Trigger**: Indicator definition or Variable Assessment Details are present.
* **Step 1 (Check Relationship)**: Is a directional or non-directional relationship between conceptual elements described within the indicator's definition/details?
* **Step 2 (Execution)**: If the condition in Step 1 is Yes, the AI must report the following information in Table 3:

    a. **Secondary variable concept type**: Begin each entry with the type of secondary variable element followed by the type of X-Y relationship present (using the X-Y relationship typology in section [14.3.2 X-Y Relationships to Record](#1432-x-y-relationships-to-record)), followed by colon space (": "), (e.g., "Predictor5: ").
    b. **Secondary Concept**: Report the concept acting as a relating variable (X) for the primary variable concept (Y), followed by comma space (", "). For example, if the primary variable concept of an indicator % active fishing permits, and the definition of the variable is "the effect of fuel costs on the proportion of fishing permits that are actively fished," AI should recognize a relating variable, "Cost of Fuel" (X) acting on the primary variable concept and enter "Cost of Fuel, " as a predictor secondary concept.
    c. **Associated Sub-category**: Report the conceptual sub-category that best matches the implied concept (e.g., "Variable costs"). (Reference definitions in section [13.3 Sub-category definitions](#133-sub-category-definitions)).
    d. **Multiplicity**: If several predictor conceptual elements are implied by the definition and/or variable assessment details, separate individual entries using a semi-colon and space ("; "). If other types of secondary variable concepts are also listed, these must also be separated by a semi-colon and space ("; ").

### **14.1.3 Conceptual proxy**
The **Primary Variable Concept** and the **Indicator Topic**, as defined in section [14.1.1 Conceptual Elements within a Single Indicator](#1411-conceptual-elements-within-a-single-indicator), are two conceptual components of an indicator. The AI must use the following steps to identify whether or not a **conceptual proxy** is present between the primary variable concept and the indicator topic:

| Step | Action and Condition |
|:---|:---|
| **Trigger** | Both the **Primary Variable Concept** and the **Indicator Topic** have been successfully matched to a conceptual sub-category (following section [13.0 Conceptual categories](#130-conceptual-categories)). | | **Step 1 (Core Test)** | **Core Test**: Compare the conceptual sub-category assigned to the **Primary Variable Concept** against the conceptual sub-category assigned to the **Indicator Topic**. Note: This check applies only after the Indicator Topic has been assigned according to the $\mathbf{MANDATE \ for \ Sub-variables}$ in section [14.1.1 Conceptual Elements within a Single Indicator](#1411-conceptual-elements-within-a-single-indicator), meaning for most sub-variables, the IT will already equal the PVC, and the result will be Proxy Absent. |
| **Step 2 (Execution)** | Determine the status and apply the output in the appropriate column (Conceptual Proxy Present): |
| | **a. Proxy Absent (Direct Measure):** If the two conceptual sub-category assignments are **IDENTICAL**, the variable is a direct measure and no conceptual proxy is present. |
| | **b. Proxy Present (Indirect Measure):** If the two conceptual sub-category assignments are **DISTINCT**, a conceptual proxy is present (e.g., using income to represent food security). |

## **14.2 Sub-variables and Outcome Variables**

I would like the AI to make note when one indicator serves as a sub-variable in the calculation of another indicator in the list of relevant indicators. Later when the AI produces a table with each indicator and its associated attributes, one attribute column will be dedicated to cross-referencing associated outcome variables (if the indicator acts as a sub-variable), and one column will be dedicated to cross-referencing associated sub-variables (if the indicator is an outcome variable built from sub-variables). The rules guiding this process are described in sections [14.2.1 Preparatory Mandates (Defining the Data Set)](#1421-preparatory-mandates-defining-the-data-set), [14.2.2 Immediate Constitutive Link Rule (Defining the Structural Requirements)](#1422-immediate-constitutive-link-rule-defining-the-structural-requirements), and [14.2.3 Verification and Execution Protocols (Ensuring Accuracy)](#1423-verification-and-execution-protocols-ensuring-accuray).

### **14.2.1 Preparatory Mandates (Defining the Data Set)**:

These rules ensure all necessary components of the constitutive hierarchy are included as discrete indicators before mapping begins:

1. **Constitutive Term Inclusion Mandate**: The AI **must ensure that any term, sub-aggregate variable, or component (X) used in the construction of a calculated outcome (Y) is separately identified and included as its own unique indicator, even if it's not explicitly titled by the source material but is present in the mathematical definition.** This mandate applies specifically to intermediate sums whose components are listed elsewhere, ensuring that the entire constitutive hierarchy (from raw input to final output) is fully represented as a chain of discrete, one-step indicators.

2. **Standard Aggregate Decomposition Protocol (SADP)**: When applying the Immediate Constitutive Link Rule to complex aggregate variables (variables whose formula explicitly sums or combines multiple sub-aggregate terms), the AI **must use the following strict decomposition to populate the Associated Sub-variable and Associated Outcome Variable columns. Inputs are Aggregates: If an indicator (A) is defined by a formula listing multiple sub-aggregate variables (e.g., A = B + C + D), the immediate, one-step inputs (Associated Sub-variables of A) are only B, C, and D (i.e., the terms that are immediately summed or combined to form A). The AI must not trace the relationship further back to the inputs of B, C, or D, strictly upholding the Hierarchical Precision and Redundancy Check (HPRC).**

### **14.2.2 Immediate Constitutive Link Rule (Defining the Structural Requirements)**

These rules establish the definitive one-step standard for all links documented in the columns and the resulting structural symmetry.

1. **Immediate Constitutive Link (One-Step Constitutive Rule)**: The population of the Associated Outcome Variable and Associated Sub-variable columns must adhere to the Immediate Constitutive Link Rule:

    a. **Associated Outcome Variable**: An indicator (X) may only list an outcome variable (Y) if X is a direct and immediate input used in the mathematical calculation of Y. X must not list an outcome variable (Z) if Z is calculated from Y (i.e., X -> Y -> Z).

    b. **Associated Sub-variable**: An indicator (Y) may only list a sub-variable (X) if X is a direct and immediate input used in the mathematical calculation of Y. Y must not list an input (W) that is used in the calculation of X (i.e., W -> X -> Y).

    > **Strict Limit on Tracing**: This rule ensures the relationship is not double-counted across multiple stages and strictly limits recorded links to direct, single-step mathematical dependency. When populating the Associated Outcome Variable column, the AI **must only list indicators that are immediately and directly calculated from the current indicator's value in a single mathematical step.** The AI **must stop tracing the chain once the relationship requires two or more computational steps** (i.e., if an indicator is already listed as an Associated Sub-variable of an indicator that appears later in the chain, it should not be listed again).

2. **Constitutive Symmetry Rule**: For any direct, immediate constitutive relationship between a Sub-variable (X) and an Outcome Variable (Y), **the relationship must be coded symmetrically across the two indicator rows**, as follows: If X lists Y’s number in its Associated Outcome Variable column, then... Y must list X's number in its Associated Sub-variable column.

3. **Structural vs. Predictive Link Mandate (Classification of X $\to$ Y Relationship)**: The directional relationship between an $\mathbf{Input \ Variable \ (X)}$ and its $\mathbf{Output \ Variable \ (Y)}$ must be classified based on $\mathbf{structural}$ or $\mathbf{causal}$ functionality to determine its mapping location: 1. **Constitutive Functionality**: If the Output Variable $\mathbf{(Y)}$ is coded as $\mathbf{Code \ 6, 7, 8, 10, \ or \ 11}$, the relationship must be mapped as a **Sub-variable $\to$ Outcome Variable link**. These are exclusively tracked in the Associated Columns (Table 2) and the Constitutive Flow Chart (P25). 2. **Predictive Functionality**: If the Output Variable $\mathbf{(Y)}$ is coded as $\mathbf{Code \ 12}$ (Narrative Causal Outcome), the relationship must be mapped as a **Relating Variable $\to$ Target Variable link**. These are exclusively tracked in the Predictive Columns (Table 2) and the Predictive Flow Chart (P26).

### **14.2.4 Verification and Execution Protocols (Ensuring Accuracy)**

These rules define the mandatory order of execution to prevent directional errors and enforce consistency.

1. **Constitutive Link Directional Verification (CLDV)**: To ensure strict adherence to the Immediate Constitutive Link Rule, the AI must first prioritize identifying all relationships by their direct flow: Sub-variable (Input)  Outcome Variable (Output). To accomplish this, following these rules:

    a. **Input Linkage Priority (Associated Sub-variable Column -> Associated Outcome Variable Column)**: For any Indicator (A) that is an Outcome Variable, the AI **must definitively list all its one-step inputs in the Associated Sub-variable Column first**, using the relevant formula.

    b. **Symmetry Enforcement (Associated Outcome Variable Column)**: Only after the Associated Sub-variable Column for Indicator A is complete, the AI **must populate the Associated Outcome Variable column for each of Indicator A's sub-variables, ensuring a symmetric cross-reference** (i.e., if Indicator B is in Indicator A’s Associated Sub-variable Column, then Indicator A must be in Indicator B’s Associated Outcome Variable Column).

    c. **Prohibited Entries Check**: The AI **must perform a final check on the Associated Outcome Variable Column of every Outcome Variable (Indicator A) and confirm that Indicator B's column does not contain the indicator numbers of its own inputs** (which would violate the rule and signal a reversal of flow logic).

## **14.3 X-Y Relationship Types**

I would like the AI to record a spectrum of relationships between an X variable (i.e., a **relating variable**) and a Y variable (i.e., a **target variable**), other than the structural relationship between sub-variables that structurally constitute a calculated outcome variable or a categorical outcome variable. The section [14.3.1 X-Y Relationship Exclusion and Inclusion Rules](#1431-x-y-relationship-exclusion-and-inclusion-rules) explains the type of structural X-Y relationship that AI should exclude from this portion of attribute identification because it has separately been captured in the relationship between sub-variables and outcome variables, as directed in section [14.2 Sub-variables and Outcome Variables](#142-sub-variables-and-outcome-variables). The section [14.3.2 X-Y Relationship to Record](#1432-x-y-relationships-to-record) provides definitions of the types of X-Y relationships that AI must distinguish and record in this potion of attribute identification. The following table lists key conceptual elements involved in X-Y relationships in this section:

| Term | Definition | Relationship Role | GIP Code Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Relating Variable (X)** | The indicator serving as the independent variable or predictor. This encompasses the Narrative Causal Element (NCE) and any quantitative causal input. | Input (Cause/Driver) | N/A |
| **Target Variable (Y)** | The indicator serving as the dependent variable or outcome that is being influenced. This encompasses the Narrative Causal Outcome (NCO) and any quantitative effect variable. | Output (Effect/Outcome) | N/A |
| **Narrative Causal Statement (NCS)** | A directional relationship (X → Y) asserted by the research authors or study participants, derived from qualitative analysis (e.g., interviews, thematic coding). The statement links a Narrative Causal Element (X) to a Narrative Causal Outcome (Y). | Systemic/Predictive | Code 5 (X-Y Relationship Type) |
| **Narrative Causal Element (NCE)** | The **input or causal factor** (X) identified in an NCS. This variable is the **Relating Variable (X)** in the predictive analysis columns. | Input (Cause) | Code 4 (Basic Variable Type) |
| **Narrative Causal Outcome (NCO)** | The **output or effect** (Y) identified in an NCS. This variable is the **Target Variable (Y)** in the predictive analysis columns. | Output (Effect) | Code 4 (Variable Type Upon Scoring); Code 12 (Outcome Type); Code 4 (Variable Type of Outcome |

### **14.3.1 X-Y Relationship Exclusion and Inclusion Rules**
The following rules guide the process of identifying relevant X-Y relationships:

1. **Structural Identity Exclusion Rule (The Definitional Test)**: The AI **must not** record an X-Y relationship (Codes 1-9) if the relationship is already captured as a structural, constitutive link as described in section [14.2 Sub-variables and Outcome Variables](#142-sub-variables-and-outcome-variables), UNLESS that constitutive link is also explicitly identified as fulfilling a Causal-Testing Role (Rule 14.3.1.3). This exclusion applies when the model relationship defines an aggregate quantity, value, or classification, including all relationships involving: <ul><li>Simple Arithmetic Identity: Relationships involving only simple arithmetic (summation, averaging, multiplication/division, ratio, or subtraction) used to define an aggregate quantity or value (e.g., $\text{Revenue} = \text{Price} \times \text{Quantity}$; $\text{Total} = \sum \text{Parts}$).</li><li>Categorical Classification Identity: The definitional step of converting a constitutive score into a category or classification (i.e., any link whose output is coded $\mathbf{Code \ 11}$ (Categorical Outcome)).</li></ul>This rule reserves the X-Y Predictive analysis for Systemic Causality (non-definitional, high-level, or statistically tested relationships). **The precedence rule is enforced by the Causal-Testing Priority Mandate (Rule 14.3.1.4).**

2. **External Predictive Role Mandate**: An indicator (X) whose primary role is to act as an Associated Sub-variable in a constitutive relationship (Codes 3, 4, or 5) **must still be recorded as a Relating Variable (X)** in the predictive columns if the study explicitly uses it as a predictor in a **separate, non-constitutive X-Y analysis**. This ensures that the indicator's **full systemic role**—both as a component (constitutive) and as a driver (predictive)—is documented, regardless of its position in a calculation chain.

3. **Statistical Causal Inclusion Mandate (The Estimation Test)**: Notwithstanding Rule 1, the AI **must include** an X-Y relationship (Codes 1-9) if the link between X and Y is defined by a **statistically estimated parameter or coefficient** that was quantified through a model-fitting process (e.g., maximizing likelihood, minimizing errors, nonlinear regression). This mandate ensures that all relationships where the study's scientific purpose is to **test or quantify a hypothesized causal influence** (e.g., calculating price flexibilities, regression coefficients) are documented in the **Relating variable** and **Target variable** columns.

4. **Causal-Testing Priority Mandate)**: When a relationship satisfies both the **Structural Identity Exclusion Rule (14.3.1.1) and the Statistical Causal Inclusion Mandate (14.3.1.3),** the Causal-Testing role **MUST** take precedence for inclusion in the predictive columns. The link must be classified as **Constitutive and Predictive (Rule 3).**

### **14.3.2 X-Y Relationships to Record**

For any X-Y relationship that is not excluded based on the X-Y Exclusion Rule, **the AI must record the type of X-Y relationships based on two characteristics**: 1. Whether the X-Y relationship is directional or non-directional, and 2. Whether evidence of the X-Y relationship is statistical or non-statistical. Later, when the AI produces a table, the numeric codes should be used as part of reporting the relating variable to indicate the type of relationship between an X and Y variable. **The output must be the numerical identifier (1 through 9) corresponding to the following typology, not the text description:**

**Mandatory Two-Step X-Y Relationship Verification Protocol**: When assigning a relationship code (1 through 9), the AI must follow this strict two-step verification to ensure accuracy:
1. **Step 1: Role and Directionality Mapping**: Identify whether the relationship is (a) Directional (X $\to$ Y; hypothesis/model explicitly tests X's influence on Y) or Non-Directional (X $\leftrightarrow$ Y; hypothesis/model tests simple association/correlation). Concurrently determine the Statistical Basis (Statistical, Non-Statistical, or Unknown).
2. **Step 2: Significance Check**: If the relationship is found to be Statistical, determine the outcome based on the reported $p$-value or equivalent metric ($\alpha = 0.05$): Significant, Not Significant, or Unknown/Not Reported. The final Code (1–9) must align precisely with the combination of Directionality and Significance status defined in the table below.

| Code | Term | Full Definition |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Directional, statistical, significant** | a directional relationship (influence of a relating variable on a target variable) was found to be statistically significant, e.g., regression analysis, sensitivity analyses, or other approaches to assessing the magnitude of effect of a single variable in a model, e.g., Cohen’s d, the Phi ($\phi$) coefficient, or Cramér's V Regression; |
| **2** | **Directional, statistical, not significant** | a directional relationship (influence of a relating variable on a target variable) was found NOT to be significant; |
| **3** | **Directional, statistical, unknown significance** | a directional relationship was present (influence of a relating variable on a target variable), but the significance of the relationship was not reported or was undetermined; |
| **4** | **Non-directional, non-statistical** | a non-directional relationship between two variables is explored in a non-statistical manner, e.g., contingency tables, mosaic plots, stacked bar charts, overlaying two spatial variables on the same map, or qualitative co-occurrence. |
| **5** | **Directional, non-statistical** | a directional relationship, in which a relating variable influences a target variable, is stated without use of inferential statistics, e.g., claims of influence are supported by evidence such as 1. relative change in a percentage over time, 2. time series of trend reporting, 3. differences of proportions across a set of categories, or narrative causal statements involving evidence from interviews or other qualitative data suggesting that one variable (relating variable) predicts or causes a change in an outcome of interest (target variable); |
| **6** | **Non-directional, statistical, significant** | a non-directional relationship between two variables is explored using statistics and found to be significant, e.g., Pearsons's r (correlation between normally distributed, continuous variables), Spearman's rank correlation (correlation between variables that are non-normally distributed), Chi-squared (used for categorical variables), and log-linear analysis (used to explore relationship between three or more categorical variables); |
| **7** | **Non-directional, statistical, not significant** | a non-directional relationship between two variables is explored using statistics and found NOT to be significant; |
| **8** | **Non-directional, statistical, unknown significance** | a non-directional relationship between two variables is not reported or undetermined, i.e., no statistical results were reported by the authors; |
| **9** | **Relationship exists but type is unknown** | it is not possible to identify whether the relationship was directional or non-directional, statistical or non-statistical, but it is clear that the author assumes a relationship between two variables. |

### **14.3.3 Relationship Identification Goal**
For every indicator, the AI **must identify its role in predictive relationships (X->Y) where the link is not already defined by the constitutive sub-variable calculation**, as directed in section [14.3.1 X-Y Relationship Exclusion and Inclusion Rules](#1431-x-y-relationship-exclusion-and-inclusion-rules). The following elements must be identified:

| Relationship Element | Definition/Context |
|:---|:---|
| **Relating Variable (X)** | Determine which indicators serve as the predictor (X) for other indicators (Y) in the study. A relating variable is any indicator (X) that is used to explore its relationships to another indicator (Y), and may include indicators characterized as a directly measured continuous/count, ordinal, nominal, or narrative variable, or any type of outcome variable. A special type of relating variable is a **narrative causal element** which is the relating variable (X) in a **narrative causal statement**. |
| **Target Variable (Y)** | Determine which indicators serve as the outcome (Y) being influenced by other indicators (X) in the study. A target variable is any indicator (Y) for which relationships with other indicators (X) are explored, and may include indicators characterized as a directly measured continuous/count, ordinal, nominal, or narrative variable, or any type of outcome variable. A special type of target variable is a **narrative causal outcome** which is the target variable (Y) in a **narrative causal statement**.  |
| **Relationship Type** | Determine the numerical code (Type 1 through 9) from the X-Y typology in section [14.3.2 X-Y Relationships to Record](#1432-x-y-relationships-to-record) for each identified relationship. |

### **14.3.4 Predictive Symmetry Rule (Cross-Referencing Output)**

When populating the output table columns for X-Y relationships, the AI must ensure complete symmetrical cross-referencing using the following rules:

| Indicator Role | Target Variable Column (X's Row) | Relating Variable Column (Y's Row) | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Relating Variable (X)** | Must list indicator number(s) of its Target variable(s) (Y). | Must list **n/a**. | Designates which variable is the predictor. |
| **Target Variable (Y)** | Must list **n/a**. | Must list indicator number(s) of reciprocal Relating variable(s) (X) + **(Type Code)**, separated by semi-colons (e.g., 4(5)). | Ensures symmetrical cross-referencing and includes the relationship type. |
| **Non-Directional (Types 4, 6, 7, 8)** | Arbitrarily assign one as X and one as Y. The X row lists Y's number. | The Y row lists X's number + (Type Code). | Relationship is recorded only once across the entire table using the single X->Y assignment. |

### **14.3.5 Principle of Systemic Causality**

When coding relationships in a complex model (like a bioeconomic simulation), the X-Y relationship typology (Type 1 through 9) must be reserved only for **emergent, high-level causal pathways and feedback loops** that define the system's management hypotheses or aggregate effects. This focuses analysis on the system-level interactions that mirror traditional predictive or causal analysis (e.g., policy levers and demographic feedback loops).

# **18.0 Prompts for Producing and Validating AI Table Outputs**

| Prompt number | Title of Prompt | Prompt instructions |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **P1** | **REVIEW GIP & OPERATIONAL PILLARS** | "The AI must review and confirm comprehension of the full Global Instruction Preamble (GIP). In your confirmation, you must explicitly acknowledge and commit to the following five Operational Pillars to ensure consistency throughout the study:<br><br>1. **Foundation Integrity (P1–P14)**: You will strictly apply the Narrative Purity Constraint (2.1.7), Parameter Inclusion Criterion (2.1.2), and Dual VAD Mandate (2.1.5) to define the master indicator pool before mapping begins.<br>2. **Immutable Data Lock (P15)**: You acknowledge that upon the execution of P15, the indicator pool (IDs and Names) becomes immutable. No indicators shall be added, renumbered, or deleted after this point to protect relational integrity.<br>3. **Relational Precision (Table 2)**: You must distinguish between constitutive and predictive links, explicitly categorizing rationales as 'Structural-Only,' 'Causal-Testing,' or 'External Causal' per Rule 16.3.2.5.<br>4. **Just-in-Time Re-scans (P26 & P32)**: You are required to re-read the specific table specifications in Sections 16.8 and 16.9 immediately before generating Tables 7 and 8 to prevent context drift.<br>5. **Technical Rigor**: All outputs must be valid pipe-delimited tables. Every cell intended for rationale or feedback must contain the 'n/a' placeholder if no entry is required; no cells may be left blank.<br><br>Confirm your comprehension and readiness to proceed according to these specific pillars." |
| **P2** | **REQUEST ARTICLE TEXT** | "AI must request the text of a new article for review." |
| **P3** | **REQUEST SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL TEXT** | "AI must request any relevant supplemental materials, if available." |
| **P4** | **PRODUCE TABLE 1 (Initial)** | "AI must produce Table 1, following instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes)." |
| **P5** | **REQUEST HUMAN INDICATOR LIST** | "AI must request the list of indicators produced by the human research team, and once the list is received AI must recreate Table 1 with two extra columns, one with the indicator ID number (XXXX&#95;X) given by the human research team, and one with the name given to the indicators by the human research team. The AI must match the human indicators to the original AI-generated list of indicators, revising the internal numbering of the original AI-generated indicator list to match the numbering of the human generated list. The AI must refresh its internal numbering of indicators using the strict rule that the AI's numbering system must match the final digits of the human-generated indicator ID (i.e., the digit(s) following the underscore, “&#95;X”). If the human research team's list includes indicators that were not included on the original AI-generated list, the AI must write \"n/a\" in the AI indicator name column and must include these indicators when populating all attributes columns. If the original AI-generated list of indicators includes an indicator that the human research team did not identify, the AI must write \"n/a\" in the new columns for Human indicator ID and human-assigned indictor name. The AI must sort the list in the order of the human indicator ID, with any of additional indicators added by the AI list at the bottom of the list, numbered in continuation from the end of the human-generated list of indicator ID numbers (e.g., if the final human-generated indicator ID ends in \"&#95;20,\" any additional indicators from the AI-generated list would start with \"21\" and continue on with \"22\" etc. until the final AI-generated indicator has been numbered." |
| **P6** | **MANDATORY NARRATIVE CAUSAL STATEMENT (NCS) CHECK** | "The AI must perform a comprehensive audit of the qualitative results and discussion sections to identify all explicit statements asserting a systemic, directional causal influence (X -> Y).<br><br>STRICT SOURCE CONSTRAINT: Pursuant to Section 3.1 (Code 4) and Rule 2.1.7 (Narrative Source Purity), a variable may ONLY be coded as Narrative (Code 4) and included as part of an NCS if it is substantiated by findings derived from raw qualitative data arising from direct engagement with human subjects (e.g., interview transcripts, field notes, observation logs).<br><br>MANDATORY EXCLUSION: Pursuant to Rule 2.1.6, the AI must explicitly exclude any causal relationships derived from the authors' historical method, discourse analysis of administrative/legal documents, or synthesis of quantitative trends, as these do not constitute 'Narrative' variables under this framework.<br><br>Mandate: For every unique NCS identified that passes the source constraint, the AI must ensure both the Narrative Causal Element (NCE, X) and the Narrative Causal Outcome (NCO, Y) are included in the indicator list as distinct indicators, even if not otherwise separately detailed.<br><br>Coding Verification: For all new and existing NCS indicators, verify compliance with the GIP:<br>1. NCE (X): -> Variable Type Upon Scoring = 4 (Narrative); Outcome Type = n/r.<br>2. NCO (Y): -> Variable Type Upon Scoring = 4; Outcome Type = 12 (Narrative causal outcome); Variable Type of Outcome = 4.<br>3. Inclusion Justification: Must be coded as 4 (Inferred (Narrative)).<br><br>Provide a rationale for any identified causal statements in the text that were REJECTED based on the Narrative Synthesis Exclusion (Rule 2.1.6), provide a rationale for any new additions or coding changes for accepted statements, and then present the final, validated Table 1 output." |
| **P7** | **DOUBLE CHECK PARAMETER INCLUSION CRITERIA** | "The AI must audit Table 1 for all indicators identified as parameters used in a formula or model, particularly those with Inclusion Justification Code 3 (Inferred) or Code 2 (Score Only). Verify strict compliance with the Parameter Inclusion Criterion (Rule 2.1.2): AI should not include **parameters** in the list of indicators **unless the parameter is actively estimated, calibrated, or set using real-world data specifically for the study's contextual or baseline assessment**. This includes parameters estimated by minimizing log likelihoods, setting to observed baseline averages, derived from secondary sources where the specific value is selected, spatially or temporally calibrated, or adjusted to fit the study's unique geographical, environmental, or baseline conditions, or otherwise adjusted to anchor the model to the local case study. Parameters treated as global, fixed constants with no contextual specificity must be removed (e.g., 'Indicator 4: Mortality Rate removed. Rationale: Sourced as a fixed constant from Smith et al. (2010), not estimated by the current study'), and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P8** | **SECTION 2.1 INTEGRITY AUDIT** | "The AI must perform a final audit on Table 1 to ensure full compliance with all Indicator Inclusion Constraints (Section 2.1), serving as a crucial verification step before entering the relationship mapping phase. Specifically, the AI must verify compliance with the following rules:<ul><li>Rule 2.1.2 (Parameter Inclusion Criterion): Confirm fixed, unadjusted constants sourced from literature have been correctly removed.</li><li>Rule 2.1.4 (Narrative Causal Statement Mandate): Confirm all NCE/NCO variables are included and coded as Narrative (Code 4) and Outcome Type 12.</li><li>Rule 2.1.5 (Dual VAD Separation Mandate): Confirm that concepts assessed by both quantitative and narrative VADs are listed as two separate, non-constitutive indicators.</li><li>Rule 2.1.7 (Narrative Synthesis Requirement): Confirm the methodological integrity of all Narrative Variables (Code 4) by verifying that the variable is the product of the study's direct synthesis of raw qualitative data (as defined in 2.1.7) and not the citation of a pre-existing summary or finding synthesized by a third party.</li></ul>List any indicator changes or coding corrections with rationale, and provide the final, validated Table 1 output." |
| **P9** | **MANDATORY DESCRIPTIVE GROUPING CHECK (MDGC)** | "AI must perform a Mandatory Descriptive Grouping Check (MDGC) to ensure all essential nominal grouping variables are included as explicit indicators for subsequent X-Y relationship mapping, preventing exclusion errors. 1. **Identify Core Segmentation:** Scan the Indicator Name and Source Context of all quantitative indicators (those with Outcome Type Code 5 or 8) to identify implicit nominal variables used for systematic data segmentation (e.g., separating data by Country, Fishing-Practice Group, or Aquaculture Environment). 2. **Flag Grouping Variables:** If a quantitative indicator (Y) consistently presents aggregated results segregated by an implicit nominal variable (X) across multiple tables/sections, the nominal variable (X) must be immediately flagged. This confirms (X) functions as a primary **Relating Variable (X)**. 3. **Enforce Inclusion:** If a flagged nominal variable (X) is not already listed, the AI must: a. **Insert it** into the indicator table as a new entry. b. Assign **Variable Type upon Scoring = 3 (Nominal)**. c. Assign **Outcome Type = n/r**. d. Assign **Inclusion Justification = 1 (Named/Defined)**. 4. **Provide Revised Table 1 and Rationale:** List the newly added indicator IDs and their rationale (e.g., \"Added Variable [X], [Group Name], due to its systematic use in segmenting Indicators [Y1, Y2, Y3] across multiple tables/figures.\"). Provide the final, revised Table 1 output." |
| **P10** | **DOUBLE CHECK TABLE 1 AGAINST VARIABLE TYPE RULES** | "The AI must re-verify that the entries in the **Variable Type upon Scoring** and **Pre-scoring Variable Type** columns in Table 1 have been populated correctly with reference to the Secondary rule. Please also re-verify the entries in the **Outcome Type** column in Table 1 to ensure that the assignments reflect the strict definitional distinctions between outcome types: **Composite index (6)** code, **Latent construct (7)** code, **Other derived outcome (8)** code, **Model output (10)** code, and **Categorical outcome (11)** code. Also verify the correct application of the **Model output (10)** code, ensuring it is inherited by all downstream calculated indicators that use a Model Output as an input. Please confirm if any changes are required, list the changes with rationale, and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P11** | **DOUBLE CHECK TABLE 1 INCLUSION JUSTIFICATION COLUMN** | "The AI must audit the **'Inclusion Justification'** column of Table 1. For any indicator marked **'Inferred (SADP),'** confirm the following: (1) It lacks both a 'Named/Defined' status and a 'Score Only' status, AND (2) Its inclusion is strictly justified by the **Hierarchical Constitutive Exception** (i.e., it is essential for completing a single-step link between two other described/scored indicators). Please confirm if any changes are required, list them with rationale, and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P12** | **VALIDATION CHECK ON CATEGORICAL INDICATOR INTEGRITY** | "This protocol ensures that nominal and categorical variables are correctly represented.<br><br>### 1. Nominal Label Exclusion Test (Consolidation Mandate)<br>Audit all indicators to ensure no two or more items represent the mutually exclusive states (labels) of a single nominal variable (e.g., Policy Scenario A, Scenario B). Consolidation is required if variables have an identical concept, non-calculated input/setting role, and pass the following criteria:<br>• **Pass Condition:** The variable must be simple (not derived/calculated) and multiple entries must map to the exact same conceptual sub-category.<br>• **Action:** Merge the labels into one single categorical indicator entry (e.g., 'Policy Scenario Type').<br><br>### 2. Essential Nominal Indicator Inclusion Test (Inclusion Mandate)<br>Audit the study's primary analyses to identify any Nominal Variable that functions as a core Target Variable (Y) or a critical, non-calculated Relating Variable (X).<br>• **Action:** If missing, include as a new entry (Variable Type -> Code 3).<br><br>### 3. Categorical Outcome Mandate (Code 11 Check)<br>Audit all included nominal/categorical variables (Code 3) against the Categorical Outcome Mandate (Section 3.2, Code 11): Apply Code 11 to high-level classifications used in comparative analysis where the classification represents an aggregation of complex characteristics.<br>• **Action:** If the variable is a high-level aggregate, recode the Outcome Type to Code 11 and ensure Variable Type columns are set to 'see sub-variables.'<br><br>If changes are required, list them with rationale and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P13** | **MANDATORY EXCLUSION LOGIC TEST** | "Identify and list three specific examples from the raw supplemental data where an item was NOT consolidated into a higher-level Composite Index (Code 6) or the Categorical Outcome (Code 11). For each example, explicitly state which clause of the Measurement Component Inclusion Mandate (16.2.1.2 a or b) prevents its consolidation, confirming that the new rule is being applied correctly to retain granular VAD data." |
| **P14** | **DUAL VAD SEPARATION AND CODING AUDIT** | "Perform a mandatory audit to confirm the correct implementation of the **Dual Variable Assessment Detail (VAD) Distinction Mandate (Rule 2.1.5)**. Specifically, audit the indicator list to identify any concepts that are assessed using two fundamentally distinct Variable Assessment Details (VADs) that lead to a difference in the fundamental variable type (Codes 1-4). 1. **Separation Check**: Confirm that any concept with both a Quantitative VAD and a Qualitative/Narrative VAD is listed as two distinct indicators. 2. **Quantitative VAD Coding**: Confirm the quantitative indicator is correctly coded to reflect its VAD (Code 1, 2, or 3) and n/r Outcome Type. 3. **Narrative VAD Coding**: Confirm the narrative indicator is correctly coded to reflect its narrative VAD (Code 4) and appropriate Outcome Type (Code 12 or n/r). List any discrepancies and provide the corrected Table 1." |
| **P15** | **FINAL TABLE 1 LOCK AND VALIDATION** | "The AI must perform a final, comprehensive audit to synchronize the human-assigned indicator list (from P5) with the AI's current validated list (incorporating all corrections from P6–P14).<br><br>1. **Indicator Sync**: Verify that every Indicator ID and Name matches the sorted human/AI merged list exactly.<br>2. **Final Variable Type Audit**: Re-confirm that every 'Outcome Type' reflects the strict definitional distinctions (Codes 6, 7, 8, 10, or 11) and that 'see sub-variables' is correctly applied in the 'Variable Type Upon Scoring' and 'Pre-scoring Variable Type' columns.<br>3. **The Lock**: Present the definitive, final version of Table 1. Explicitly state: 'This version of Table 1 is now the immutable reference for all downstream tables. No indicators will be added, removed, or renumbered after this point.'<br>4. **State Refresh**: Briefly summarize the Column Specifications for Table 2 (Section 16.3.2) to ensure active comprehension before proceeding." |
| **P16** | **PRODUCE TABLE 2 (WITH X-Y VALIDATION)** | "Using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1, the AI must produce Table 2, following instructions in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes). **Immediately following table creation, the AI must perform a validation audit:** For all entries in the **Target variable** and **Relating variable** columns of Table 2 where a relationship code (1-9) is present, the AI must explicitly document the model's **directionality** (Directional/Non-Directional) and its final **statistical finding** (Significant/Not Significant) as derived from the source text or outputs, and verify that the resulting relationship code aligns exactly with the definitions and protocols in Section 14.3.2. List any identified errors and corrections with rationale, and then present the final, validated Table 2." |
| **P17** | **CATEGORICAL LINK STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY CHECK** | "The AI must audit Table 2 to ensure all **Constitutive Links** are strictly excluded from the predictive columns (Target/Relating). Specifically: **Mandate**: For any Indicator (Y) whose **Outcome Type** in Table 1 is Code 11 (Categorical Outcome), and whose link (X $\to$ Y) is designated as constitutive (X is listed in the Associated Sub-variable column of Y): 1. The **Relating variable** column for Y MUST be set to 'n/a' (or contain only non-constitutive links). 2. The **Target variable** column for X MUST be set to 'n/a' (or contain only non-constitutive links). List any identified constitutive link (X $\to$ Y) that was incorrectly included in the predictive columns with rationale (Rule 14.3.1 Exclusion) and provide the corrected Table 2 output." |
| **P18** | **CONSTITUTIVE FLOW AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AUDIT** | "Audit Table 2 to verify the integrity of the constitutive indicator chain and structural rules, applicable to any article: 1. Immediate Constitutive Link Rule Check: Confirm strict adherence to the **Immediate Constitutive Link Rule** (14.2.2). Verify that input sub-variables link only to their direct aggregate outcome variable, and that aggregate variables (e.g., intermediate indices) are correctly chained up to the final highest-level outcome variable. 2. Narrative/Quantitative Separation Check: Confirm that indicators whose Variable Type Upon Scoring is **Narrative (Code 4)** are **entirely absent** from the Associated Outcome Variable and Associated Sub-variable columns. (They must only appear in the predictive columns, per the structural exclusion mandate and Rule 2.1.5). 3. Synchronization Mandate Check: Confirm that every input sub-variable is correctly assigned the corresponding **Conceptual Relationship Code** (Code 3, 4, or 5) in Table 4 (when produced), based on the final Outcome Type of its immediate Associated Outcome Variable (Codes 7, 6, or 8/11, respectively). List any identified errors and provide the corrected Table 2." |
| **P19** | **PRODUCE TABLE 3** | "Using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1, the AI must produce Table 3, following instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes)." |
| **P20** | **PRODUCE TABLE 4** | "Using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1, the AI must produce Table 4, following instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes)." |
| **P21** | **PRODUCE TABLE 5** | "Using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1, the AI must produce Table 5, following instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes). **MANDATORY VALIDATION STEP:** The AI must audit the **Conceptual Proxy Present** column to ensure strict compliance with the **Inclusion Constraint (Derived Indicators)** (Section 16.6.1, Column 1). Specifically, if the indicator's **Outcome Type** (Table 1) is Code **6, 7, 8, 10, or 11**, the **Conceptual Proxy Present** column **MUST be set to \"n/a\"** regardless of any comparison between the Primary Variable Concept and the Indicator Topic. Provide a revised Table 5 output if corrections were required." |
| **P22** | **PRODUCE TABLE 6** | "AI must re-read Section [16.7 Table 6 Specifications](#167-table-6-specifications) and then produce Table 6 using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1. In producing Table 6, the AI must also follow general instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes). Ensure the 'Rationale' column citations strictly use Indicator numbers (e.g., 'sub-variable of 24') and specify the exact GIP rule number applied for each code." |
| **P23** | **COMPLEX LOGIC CHECK: DESCRIPTIVE STATS INTEGRITY** | "The AI must audit all indicators in Table 6 for compliance with the **Descriptive Statistics Integrity Rules** concerning Outcome Type Code 5 (Descriptive statistics):<br><br>1. **Code 6 Exclusion Mandate:** For every indicator with Outcome Type Code 5 in Table 1, verify that **Code 6** (Outcome variable) is **NOT** present in the **Conceptual Relationship Code** column in Table 4 (Section 4.2 constraint).<br><br>2. **Code 1/2 Priority Mandate:** For every indicator with Outcome Type Code 5 in Table 1 and **n/a** in the **Associated Sub-variable** column in Table 2, confirm that the **Conceptual Relationship Code** in Table 4 is either **1** or **2** (and not **7**), depending on the conceptual proxy status in Table 5 (Section 4.2 priority rule).<br><br>Provide a rationale for any discrepancies found and a final, corrected Table 6 output." |
| **P24** | **CONCEPTUAL PURITY CHECK (CODE 1 EXCLUSIVITY)** | "The AI must audit Table 6 for all instances where Conceptual Relationship Code 1 co-occurs with any other conceptual relationship code (Codes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7). **Mandate for Code 1 Exclusion**: Pursuant to the Co-occurrence Rules in Section [4.2 Conceptual Relationship Typology](#42-conceptual-relationship-typology), Code 1 is strictly prohibited from co-occurring with any other code. For every instance of co-occurrence found, the AI must immediately correct Table 6 by **removing Code 1** from the entry, retaining only the remaining code(s) (e.g., changing '1; 4' to '4'). This correction enforces the definition that Code 1 applies only to indicators that are **NOT a constitutive sub-variable.** Provide a brief rationale for the correction and present the final, validated Table 6 output." |
| **P25** | **COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPTUAL RELATIONSHIP AUDIT** | "Audit Table 6 to verify the integrity of all Conceptual Relationship Codes (1-7) against the GIP definitions:<br><br>1. **Constitutive Synchronization Check (Codes 3, 4, 5 Priority)**: Confirm all sub-variables in Table 2 are assigned the correct input code (3, 4, or 5) in Table 6, explicitly synchronized with the Outcome Type (6, 7, 8, or 11) of its immediate Associated Outcome Variable in Table 1.<br>2. **Outcome Status Check (Code 6/7/8/11)**: Confirm Code 6 (Outcome variable) in Table 6 is assigned ONLY to indicators whose Outcome Type in Table 1 includes Code 6, 7, 8, or 11.<br>3. **Single Variable Status Check (Codes 1 & 2)**:<br>• Confirm Code 1 is assigned ONLY to non-constitutive indicators where the PVC and Indicator Topic are identical.<br>• Confirm Code 2 is assigned ONLY to non-constitutive indicators where a proxy is present.<br>• **Univariate Transformation Guardrail**: Pursuant to Section 3.2.1.1, verify that indicators representing a single variable that has been re-binned or transformed are NOT assigned Outcome Type 6, 7, 8, or 11.<br>4. **Exclusion Check (Code 1)**: Confirm Code 1 is strictly prohibited from co-occurring with any other constitutive code (Codes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).<br><br>List any discrepancies and provide the corrected Table 6 output." |

| **P30** | **X-Y Relationship Flow Chart Generation Prompt** | "Create a similar flow chart for relating variables to target variables, with the following specifications:<br><br>1. **Status (N, S, I)**: Use the correct code from the Inclusion Justification for the status of the Relating Variable (X). (Rationale: Ensures consistency in detailing origin).<br>2. **X-Y Relationship Code**: The Conceptual Code column must use the **X-Y Relationship Type Code (1-9)**, not the Constitutive Link Code (3, 4, 5). (Rationale: Clarifies distinction between causal (X-Y) and mathematical (Constitutive) one)." |
| **P31** | **Verify X-Y Relationship Typology** | "Verify that the X-Y relationship flow chart relied on the **Predictive X-Y relationship codes (Codes 1–9)** from section [14.3.2 X-Y Relationships to Record](#1432-x-y-relationships-to-record) of the Global Instruction Preamble (GIP)." |
