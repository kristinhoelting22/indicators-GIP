# **4.0 Conceptual Relationship Coding**

## **4.1 Constraint on Conceptual Coding (Predictive Independence)**: The coding of conceptual relationship type (Codes 1 through 7, as defined in the sub-section [4.2 Conceptual Relationship Typology](#4.2-conceptual-relationship-typology), **must be determined solely by the indicator's internal characteristics (proxy status) and its role in constitutive relationships (Associated Outcome/Sub-variable). These codes must be treated as independent of, and should not be influenced by, whether the indicator is used as a Relating variable (X) or a Target variable (Y) in the study's X-Y predictive analyses.**

### **4.1.1 Conceptual Relationship Priority Mandate (Code 6/8 Distinction)**:

When classifying an aggregate variable whose calculation involves a formula, statistical technique (e.g., MDS, Factor Analysis), or other complex derivation, the determination between Composite Index (Code 6) and Other Derived Outcome (Code 8) MUST prioritize the study authors' explicit or implicit conceptual framing of the output over the mathematical complexity.

If the study explicitly or implicitly frames the aggregate index as representing a conceptual whole that is composed of or summarized by its input sub-variables (i.e., making a claim of conceptual representation), the index MUST be coded as a Composite Index (Code 6). This classification holds even if the calculation uses complex scaling, weighting, or statistical transformation (e.g., RAPFISH/MDS) that mathematically breaks a simple additive link.

Code Other Derived Outcome (Code 8) is reserved only for aggregated outputs where the study makes no conceptual claim of composition, or where the output is strictly mathematical (e.g., complex ratios, simple structural transformations, or residual components lacking conceptual definition).

## **4.2 Conceptual Relationship Typology**

The following typology should be used to characterize the presence or absence of a within-indicator conceptual relationship (i.e., conceptual proxy) and/or the role of an indicator in a constitutive conceptual relationship with a separate indicator (i.e., the role of an indicator as a sub-variable or an outcome variable). The AI **must use the code numbers rather than text to indicate relevant conceptual relationships** in Table 4. The conceptual relationship codes are as follows:

| Code | Term | Role / Definition | Co-occurrence Rules |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **No proxy single variable** | Directly measured, variable concept equals indicator topic, and NOT a constitutive sub-variable. **Priority Rule (Descriptive Stats):** This code **MUST** be used, and Code 7 **MUST NOT** be used, if the indicator meets this definition and the only reason it would not be a single variable is the presence of an **Outcome Type Code 5 (Descriptive statistics).** | **Cannot co-occur** with any other code. |
| **2** | **Conceptual proxy single variable** | Directly measured, and the variable concept is located in a distinct sub-category from the indicator topic (Proxy present). Priority Rule (Descriptive Stats): This code MUST be used, and Code 7 MUST NOT be used, if the indicator meets this definition, regardless of the presence of an Outcome Type Code 5 (Descriptive statistics).| **Can co-occur** with codes #3, #4, #5, #6. **Cannot co-occur** with code #7. |
| **3** | **Sub-variable of a latent construct** | Constitutive sub-variable used to calculate a latent construct. **Mandate**: This code applies if the immediate Associated Outcome Variable's Outcome Type is Latent construct (Code 7), whether modeled (Code 7, 10) or non-modeled (Code 7). **Dual Role Clarification**: This indicator may itself be a calculated outcome (Code 6) from a previous step, necessitating the co-occurrence code $\mathbf{6; 3}$. | **Can co-occur** with code #2 or #6. **Cannot co-occur** with codes #1, #4, #5, or #7. |
| **4** | **Sub-variable of a composite index** | Constitutive sub-variable used to calculate a composite index. **Mandate**: This code applies if the immediate Associated Outcome Variable's Outcome Type is Composite Index (Code 6), whether modeled (Code 6, 10) or non-modeled (Code 6). **Dual Role Clarification**: This indicator may itself be a calculated outcome (Code 6) from a previous step, necessitating the co-occurrence code $\mathbf{6; 4}$. | **Can co-occur** with code #2 or #6. **Cannot co-occur** with codes #1, #3, #5, or #7. |
| **5** | **Sub-variable of a derived outcome** | Constitutive sub-variable used to calculate a derived outcome other than a latent construct or a composite index. **Mandate**: This code applies if the immediate Associated Outcome Variable's Outcome Type is Other Derived Outcome (Code 8), whether modeled (Code 8, 10) or non-modeled (Code 8), or Categorical Outcome (Code 11). **Dual Role Clarification**: This indicator may itself be a calculated outcome (Code 6) from a previous step, necessitating the co-occurrence code $\mathbf{6; 5}$. | Can co-occur with code #2 or #6. Cannot co-occur with codes #1, #3, #4, or #7. |
| **6** | **Outcome variable** | The indicator is a calculated outcome, model output, or categorical outcome connected to other sub-variables in this list (or clearly implied). Constraint: This code applies **ONLY** if the Outcome Type includes the Code 6, 7, 8, or 11. It **MUST NOT** be applied if the Outcome Type is Code 5 (Descriptive statistics). | **Can co-occur** with code #2, #3, #4, or #5. **Cannot co-occur** with code #7. |
| **7** | **Other** | Reserved for residual cases that are not constitutive (no Code 3, 4, 5, 6) and whose conceptual components (Primary Variable Concept or Indicator Topic) are so poorly detailed that they **cannot be matched to any other category (Code 1 or 2).** |

## **4.3 Constitutive Code Synchronization Rule**

**Priority Rule for Co-occurring Outcome Types (Codes 6, 7, and 10)**: When an Associated Outcome Variable (Y) is coded as a **Model Output (10)** and also includes a Conceptual Type (Code 6 or 7), the input Indicator's (X) constitutive code (**3 or 4**) must reflect the Conceptual Type (6 or 7), rather than the Model Output's generic input code (**5**). Codes 3 and 4 take precedence over Code 5. This maintains the integrity of the conceptual typology (Latent Construct or Composite Index) over the method of calculation (Modeled).

**Synchronization Reference Table**: If an indicator acts as a sub-variable for another indicator, the assignment of the conceptual relationship code (3, 4, or 5) must be explicitly synchronized with the Outcome Type of its immediate Associated Outcome Variable(s) reported in Table 1. This check ensures that the input (sub-variable) relationship code perfectly matches the output (outcome variable) typology. The synchronization Reference Table is as follows:

| If Output Indicator (Y) is Code... | ...Then Input Indicator (X) Must Be Code... | Full Definition of Rule |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **6** (**Composite Index**), or **6, 10** | **4** (**Sub-variable of a composite index**) | If the immediate Associated Outcome Variable (Y) is a Composite Index (**6** or **6, 10**) in Table 1, the sub-variable (X) is a constitutive building block of a multifaceted concept (**Parts → Whole**). In this case, the sub-variable (X) must be coded as **4** (Sub-variable of a composite index). (Priority over Code 5) |
| **7** (**Latent Construct**), or **7, 10** | **3** (**Sub-variable of a latent construct**) | If the immediate Associated Outcome Variable (Y) is a Latent Construct (**7** or **7, 10**) in Table 1, the sub-variable (X) is an observable manifestation of the unobservable state (**Whole → Parts**). In this case, the sub-variable (X) must be coded as **3** (Sub-variable of a latent construct). (Priority over Code 5) |
| **8** (**Other Derived Outcome**), or **8, 10** | **5** (**Sub-variable of a derived outcome**) | If the immediate Associated Outcome Variable (Y) is an Other Derived Outcome (**8**) in Table 1, the sub-variable (X) is a component of a functional ratio, structural tally, or other strictly arithmetic calculation that does not imply the calculation of a multifaceted concept (Arithmetic Utility). In this case, the sub-variable (X) must be coded as **5** (Sub-variable of a derived outcome). |
| **10** (**Model output**) | **5** (**Sub-variable of a derived outcome**) | If the immediate Associated Outcome Variable (Y) is coded as Model Output (**10**) alone (no 6 or 7), the input (X) is a generic modeled numerical parameter. In this case, the sub-variable (X) must be coded as **5** (Sub-variable of a derived outcome). |
| **11** (**Categorical Outcome**), or **11, 10** | **5** (**Sub-variable of a derived outcome**) | If the immediate Associated Outcome variable (Y) is a Categorical Outcome (**11** or **11, 10**) in Table 1, the sub-variable (X) is an **Identity Attribute** used to define a typology or kind. In this case, the sub-variable (X) must be coded as **5** (Sub-variable of a derived outcome). **[RATIONALE MANDATE]**: The rationale must specify that (X) defines a typological identity/regime. |

# **13.0 Conceptual Categories**

For each indicator identified by the AI, I would like the AI to determine the concept of the variable being assessed – the **variable concept** – with reference to a set of conceptual categories. In addition, I would like the AI to determine whether the overarching indicator is being used to indicate the same concept that the variable is assessing, or if the **indicator topic** is in fact conceptually distinct from the variable concept. In such cases, a **conceptual proxy** is present in the construction of the indicator, as described in section [14.1.3 Conceptual proxy](#1413-conceptual-proxy). This means that a variable of one concept is being used as the basis for an indicator that is representing a distinct concept. For example, the variable may assess income levels of fishers, but the indicator may be intended to represent food security of fishers. Because it is possible that the variable concept is distinct from the concept of the indicator topic, I will ask the AI to identify both the variable concept and the indicator topic and to match each to the best conceptual category. If the variable concept and indicator topic are the same, both will be coded to the same category.

**Indicator Topic Conceptual Scope Constraint**: The **Indicator Topic** (the **conceptual representation target**) must be matched to a concept within a specific Primary Category (see section [13.2 Primary Category Definitions](#132-primary-category-definitions)) and Sub-category (see section [13.3 Sub-category definitions](#133-sub-category-definitions)). The sole exception is when authors explicitly design an indicator to assess a high-level conceptual theme, such as "sustainability" writ large; only in these rare cases should the Indicator Topic be coded to a sub-category within the **Larger sustainability theme** Primary Category. The standard, targeted concepts in the framework (e.g., Harvest characteristics, Material benefits, Rule of law) must be prioritized over high-level sustainability themes, even if the indicator is noted as "contributing to" a sustainability theme.

## **13.1 Process for matching a concept to a sub-category**

    1. **Select primary category**: The first step in determining the appropriate **sub-category** to code the variable concept and the indicator topic is to identify which **primary category** is the best conceptual location, i.e., does the indicator have to do with fishery participant well-being (capabilities, conditions, or connections), fishery governance (characteristics or performance), the fishery system (characteristics or performance, including economic, environmental, and social performance), or context (environmental context, human dimensions context, or community context). Definitions for each primary category are provided in the section [13.2 Primary Category Definitions](#13.2-primary-category-definitions).

    2. **Select sub-category within the chosen primary category**: The second step in determining the appropriate sub-category to code the variable concept and the indicator topic is to identify the best sub-category within the selected primary category. Sub-category definitions are provided in the section [13.3 Sub-Category Definitions](#13.3-sub-category-definitions).

### **13.1.1 Notes and Special Rules for Sub-category Selection**:

* **General and Other Sub-categories**: "General" and "Other" sub-categories exist within each primary category. These are included in the event that either: a. AI can identify the appropriate primary category, but no sub-category offers the correct conceptual fit (in which case AI must code to the "Other" sub-category within the selected primary category), or b. the variable concept or indicator topic spans more than one conceptual sub-category within the selected primary category (in which case AI must code to the “General” sub-category within the selected primary category).
* **Examples Provided in Definitions are Not Exhaustive**: The existing definitions of primary categories and sub-categories currently include various examples to help AI locate the best-fit sub-category for a given variable concept or indicator topic, but the examples listed in the definitions are not exhaustive. **If the AI notices that a definition is a good fit in general, but the specific example of the variable concept or indicator topic is not reflected in the existing definition, AI must flag the example as a recommended addition to the definition. AI must also recommend adjustments to primary category or sub-category definitions if AI notices inconsistencies within a single definition or unnecessary conceptual overlaps between definitions of multiple categories.**
* **Use Full Sub-Category Name**: In the Table outputs, when identifying the best sub-category for an indicator’s **variable concept** or an indicator’s **indicator topic**, the AI **must indicate the sub-category name word for word.**

## **13.2 Primary Category Definitions**
FAO's primary conceptual categories have been redacted from this version of the GIP. FAO is in the process of finalizing their conceptual classification system. Once category definitions have been finalized this GIP will be updated with primary category names and definitions that AI can use to carry out conceptual coding of identified indicators.

## **13.3 Sub-category definitions**
FAO's conceptual sub-category definitions have been redacted from this version of the GIP. FAO is in the process of finalizing their conceptual classification system. Once category definitions have been finalized this GIP will be updated with primary category names and definitions that AI can use to carry out conceptual coding of identified indicators.

# **18.0 Prompts for Producing and Validating AI Table Outputs**

| Prompt number | Title of Prompt | Prompt instructions |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **P1** | **REVIEW GIP & OPERATIONAL PILLARS** | "The AI must review and confirm comprehension of the full Global Instruction Preamble (GIP). In your confirmation, you must explicitly acknowledge and commit to the following five Operational Pillars to ensure consistency throughout the study:<br><br>1. **Foundation Integrity (P1–P14)**: You will strictly apply the Narrative Purity Constraint (2.1.7), Parameter Inclusion Criterion (2.1.2), and Dual VAD Mandate (2.1.5) to define the master indicator pool before mapping begins.<br>2. **Immutable Data Lock (P15)**: You acknowledge that upon the execution of P15, the indicator pool (IDs and Names) becomes immutable. No indicators shall be added, renumbered, or deleted after this point to protect relational integrity.<br>3. **Relational Precision (Table 2)**: You must distinguish between constitutive and predictive links, explicitly categorizing rationales as 'Structural-Only,' 'Causal-Testing,' or 'External Causal' per Rule 16.3.2.5.<br>4. **Just-in-Time Re-scans (P26 & P32)**: You are required to re-read the specific table specifications in Sections 16.8 and 16.9 immediately before generating Tables 7 and 8 to prevent context drift.<br>5. **Technical Rigor**: All outputs must be valid pipe-delimited tables. Every cell intended for rationale or feedback must contain the 'n/a' placeholder if no entry is required; no cells may be left blank.<br><br>Confirm your comprehension and readiness to proceed according to these specific pillars." |
| **P2** | **REQUEST ARTICLE TEXT** | "AI must request the text of a new article for review." |
| **P3** | **REQUEST SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL TEXT** | "AI must request any relevant supplemental materials, if available." |
| **P4** | **PRODUCE TABLE 1 (Initial)** | "AI must produce Table 1, following instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes)." |
| **P5** | **REQUEST HUMAN INDICATOR LIST** | "AI must request the list of indicators produced by the human research team, and once the list is received AI must recreate Table 1 with two extra columns, one with the indicator ID number (XXXX&#95;X) given by the human research team, and one with the name given to the indicators by the human research team. The AI must match the human indicators to the original AI-generated list of indicators, revising the internal numbering of the original AI-generated indicator list to match the numbering of the human generated list. The AI must refresh its internal numbering of indicators using the strict rule that the AI's numbering system must match the final digits of the human-generated indicator ID (i.e., the digit(s) following the underscore, “&#95;X”). If the human research team's list includes indicators that were not included on the original AI-generated list, the AI must write \"n/a\" in the AI indicator name column and must include these indicators when populating all attributes columns. If the original AI-generated list of indicators includes an indicator that the human research team did not identify, the AI must write \"n/a\" in the new columns for Human indicator ID and human-assigned indictor name. The AI must sort the list in the order of the human indicator ID, with any of additional indicators added by the AI list at the bottom of the list, numbered in continuation from the end of the human-generated list of indicator ID numbers (e.g., if the final human-generated indicator ID ends in \"&#95;20,\" any additional indicators from the AI-generated list would start with \"21\" and continue on with \"22\" etc. until the final AI-generated indicator has been numbered." |
| **P6** | **MANDATORY NARRATIVE CAUSAL STATEMENT (NCS) CHECK** | "The AI must perform a comprehensive audit of the qualitative results and discussion sections to identify all explicit statements asserting a systemic, directional causal influence (X -> Y).<br><br>STRICT SOURCE CONSTRAINT: Pursuant to Section 3.1 (Code 4) and Rule 2.1.7 (Narrative Source Purity), a variable may ONLY be coded as Narrative (Code 4) and included as part of an NCS if it is substantiated by findings derived from raw qualitative data arising from direct engagement with human subjects (e.g., interview transcripts, field notes, observation logs).<br><br>MANDATORY EXCLUSION: Pursuant to Rule 2.1.6, the AI must explicitly exclude any causal relationships derived from the authors' historical method, discourse analysis of administrative/legal documents, or synthesis of quantitative trends, as these do not constitute 'Narrative' variables under this framework.<br><br>Mandate: For every unique NCS identified that passes the source constraint, the AI must ensure both the Narrative Causal Element (NCE, X) and the Narrative Causal Outcome (NCO, Y) are included in the indicator list as distinct indicators, even if not otherwise separately detailed.<br><br>Coding Verification: For all new and existing NCS indicators, verify compliance with the GIP:<br>1. NCE (X): -> Variable Type Upon Scoring = 4 (Narrative); Outcome Type = n/r.<br>2. NCO (Y): -> Variable Type Upon Scoring = 4; Outcome Type = 12 (Narrative causal outcome); Variable Type of Outcome = 4.<br>3. Inclusion Justification: Must be coded as 4 (Inferred (Narrative)).<br><br>Provide a rationale for any identified causal statements in the text that were REJECTED based on the Narrative Synthesis Exclusion (Rule 2.1.6), provide a rationale for any new additions or coding changes for accepted statements, and then present the final, validated Table 1 output." |
| **P7** | **DOUBLE CHECK PARAMETER INCLUSION CRITERIA** | "The AI must audit Table 1 for all indicators identified as parameters used in a formula or model, particularly those with Inclusion Justification Code 3 (Inferred) or Code 2 (Score Only). Verify strict compliance with the Parameter Inclusion Criterion (Rule 2.1.2): AI should not include **parameters** in the list of indicators **unless the parameter is actively estimated, calibrated, or set using real-world data specifically for the study's contextual or baseline assessment**. This includes parameters estimated by minimizing log likelihoods, setting to observed baseline averages, derived from secondary sources where the specific value is selected, spatially or temporally calibrated, or adjusted to fit the study's unique geographical, environmental, or baseline conditions, or otherwise adjusted to anchor the model to the local case study. Parameters treated as global, fixed constants with no contextual specificity must be removed (e.g., 'Indicator 4: Mortality Rate removed. Rationale: Sourced as a fixed constant from Smith et al. (2010), not estimated by the current study'), and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P8** | **SECTION 2.1 INTEGRITY AUDIT** | "The AI must perform a final audit on Table 1 to ensure full compliance with all Indicator Inclusion Constraints (Section 2.1), serving as a crucial verification step before entering the relationship mapping phase. Specifically, the AI must verify compliance with the following rules:<ul><li>Rule 2.1.2 (Parameter Inclusion Criterion): Confirm fixed, unadjusted constants sourced from literature have been correctly removed.</li><li>Rule 2.1.4 (Narrative Causal Statement Mandate): Confirm all NCE/NCO variables are included and coded as Narrative (Code 4) and Outcome Type 12.</li><li>Rule 2.1.5 (Dual VAD Separation Mandate): Confirm that concepts assessed by both quantitative and narrative VADs are listed as two separate, non-constitutive indicators.</li><li>Rule 2.1.7 (Narrative Synthesis Requirement): Confirm the methodological integrity of all Narrative Variables (Code 4) by verifying that the variable is the product of the study's direct synthesis of raw qualitative data (as defined in 2.1.7) and not the citation of a pre-existing summary or finding synthesized by a third party.</li></ul>List any indicator changes or coding corrections with rationale, and provide the final, validated Table 1 output." |
| **P9** | **MANDATORY DESCRIPTIVE GROUPING CHECK (MDGC)** | "AI must perform a Mandatory Descriptive Grouping Check (MDGC) to ensure all essential nominal grouping variables are included as explicit indicators for subsequent X-Y relationship mapping, preventing exclusion errors. 1. **Identify Core Segmentation:** Scan the Indicator Name and Source Context of all quantitative indicators (those with Outcome Type Code 5 or 8) to identify implicit nominal variables used for systematic data segmentation (e.g., separating data by Country, Fishing-Practice Group, or Aquaculture Environment). 2. **Flag Grouping Variables:** If a quantitative indicator (Y) consistently presents aggregated results segregated by an implicit nominal variable (X) across multiple tables/sections, the nominal variable (X) must be immediately flagged. This confirms (X) functions as a primary **Relating Variable (X)**. 3. **Enforce Inclusion:** If a flagged nominal variable (X) is not already listed, the AI must: a. **Insert it** into the indicator table as a new entry. b. Assign **Variable Type upon Scoring = 3 (Nominal)**. c. Assign **Outcome Type = n/r**. d. Assign **Inclusion Justification = 1 (Named/Defined)**. 4. **Provide Revised Table 1 and Rationale:** List the newly added indicator IDs and their rationale (e.g., \"Added Variable [X], [Group Name], due to its systematic use in segmenting Indicators [Y1, Y2, Y3] across multiple tables/figures.\"). Provide the final, revised Table 1 output." |
| **P10** | **DOUBLE CHECK TABLE 1 AGAINST VARIABLE TYPE RULES** | "The AI must re-verify that the entries in the **Variable Type upon Scoring** and **Pre-scoring Variable Type** columns in Table 1 have been populated correctly with reference to the Secondary rule. Please also re-verify the entries in the **Outcome Type** column in Table 1 to ensure that the assignments reflect the strict definitional distinctions between outcome types: **Composite index (6)** code, **Latent construct (7)** code, **Other derived outcome (8)** code, **Model output (10)** code, and **Categorical outcome (11)** code. Also verify the correct application of the **Model output (10)** code, ensuring it is inherited by all downstream calculated indicators that use a Model Output as an input. Please confirm if any changes are required, list the changes with rationale, and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P11** | **DOUBLE CHECK TABLE 1 INCLUSION JUSTIFICATION COLUMN** | "The AI must audit the **'Inclusion Justification'** column of Table 1. For any indicator marked **'Inferred (SADP),'** confirm the following: (1) It lacks both a 'Named/Defined' status and a 'Score Only' status, AND (2) Its inclusion is strictly justified by the **Hierarchical Constitutive Exception** (i.e., it is essential for completing a single-step link between two other described/scored indicators). Please confirm if any changes are required, list them with rationale, and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P12** | **VALIDATION CHECK ON CATEGORICAL INDICATOR INTEGRITY** | "This protocol ensures that nominal and categorical variables are correctly represented.<br><br>### 1. Nominal Label Exclusion Test (Consolidation Mandate)<br>Audit all indicators to ensure no two or more items represent the mutually exclusive states (labels) of a single nominal variable (e.g., Policy Scenario A, Scenario B). Consolidation is required if variables have an identical concept, non-calculated input/setting role, and pass the following criteria:<br>• **Pass Condition:** The variable must be simple (not derived/calculated) and multiple entries must map to the exact same conceptual sub-category.<br>• **Action:** Merge the labels into one single categorical indicator entry (e.g., 'Policy Scenario Type').<br><br>### 2. Essential Nominal Indicator Inclusion Test (Inclusion Mandate)<br>Audit the study's primary analyses to identify any Nominal Variable that functions as a core Target Variable (Y) or a critical, non-calculated Relating Variable (X).<br>• **Action:** If missing, include as a new entry (Variable Type -> Code 3).<br><br>### 3. Categorical Outcome Mandate (Code 11 Check)<br>Audit all included nominal/categorical variables (Code 3) against the Categorical Outcome Mandate (Section 3.2, Code 11): Apply Code 11 to high-level classifications used in comparative analysis where the classification represents an aggregation of complex characteristics.<br>• **Action:** If the variable is a high-level aggregate, recode the Outcome Type to Code 11 and ensure Variable Type columns are set to 'see sub-variables.'<br><br>If changes are required, list them with rationale and provide a revised Table 1 output." |
| **P13** | **MANDATORY EXCLUSION LOGIC TEST** | "Identify and list three specific examples from the raw supplemental data where an item was NOT consolidated into a higher-level Composite Index (Code 6) or the Categorical Outcome (Code 11).

| **P21** | **PRODUCE TABLE 5** | "Using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1, the AI must produce Table 5, following instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes). **MANDATORY VALIDATION STEP:** The AI must audit the **Conceptual Proxy Present** column to ensure strict compliance with the **Inclusion Constraint (Derived Indicators)** (Section 16.6.1, Column 1). Specifically, if the indicator's **Outcome Type** (Table 1) is Code **6, 7, 8, 10, or 11**, the **Conceptual Proxy Present** column **MUST be set to \"n/a\"** regardless of any comparison between the Primary Variable Concept and the Indicator Topic. Provide a revised Table 5 output if corrections were required." |
| **P22** | **PRODUCE TABLE 6** | "AI must re-read Section [16.7 Table 6 Specifications](#167-table-6-specifications) and then produce Table 6 using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1. In producing Table 6, the AI must also follow general instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes). Ensure the 'Rationale' column citations strictly use Indicator numbers (e.g., 'sub-variable of 24') and specify the exact GIP rule number applied for each code." |
| **P23** | **COMPLEX LOGIC CHECK: DESCRIPTIVE STATS INTEGRITY** | "The AI must audit all indicators in Table 6 for compliance with the **Descriptive Statistics Integrity Rules** concerning Outcome Type Code 5 (Descriptive statistics):<br><br>1. **Code 6 Exclusion Mandate:** For every indicator with Outcome Type Code 5 in Table 1, verify that **Code 6** (Outcome variable) is **NOT** present in the **Conceptual Relationship Code** column in Table 4 (Section 4.2 constraint).<br><br>2. **Code 1/2 Priority Mandate:** For every indicator with Outcome Type Code 5 in Table 1 and **n/a** in the **Associated Sub-variable** column in Table 2, confirm that the **Conceptual Relationship Code** in Table 4 is either **1** or **2** (and not **7**), depending on the conceptual proxy status in Table 5 (Section 4.2 priority rule).<br><br>Provide a rationale for any discrepancies found and a final, corrected Table 6 output." |
| **P24** | **CONCEPTUAL PURITY CHECK (CODE 1 EXCLUSIVITY)** | "The AI must audit Table 6 for all instances where Conceptual Relationship Code 1 co-occurs with any other conceptual relationship code (Codes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7). **Mandate for Code 1 Exclusion**: Pursuant to the Co-occurrence Rules in Section [4.2 Conceptual Relationship Typology](#42-conceptual-relationship-typology), Code 1 is strictly prohibited from co-occurring with any other code. For every instance of co-occurrence found, the AI must immediately correct Table 6 by **removing Code 1** from the entry, retaining only the remaining code(s) (e.g., changing '1; 4' to '4'). This correction enforces the definition that Code 1 applies only to indicators that are **NOT a constitutive sub-variable.** Provide a brief rationale for the correction and present the final, validated Table 6 output." |
| **P25** | **COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPTUAL RELATIONSHIP AUDIT** | "Audit Table 6 to verify the integrity of all Conceptual Relationship Codes (1-7) against the GIP definitions:<br><br>1. **Constitutive Synchronization Check (Codes 3, 4, 5 Priority)**: Confirm all sub-variables in Table 2 are assigned the correct input code (3, 4, or 5) in Table 6, explicitly synchronized with the Outcome Type (6, 7, 8, or 11) of its immediate Associated Outcome Variable in Table 1.<br>2. **Outcome Status Check (Code 6/7/8/11)**: Confirm Code 6 (Outcome variable) in Table 6 is assigned ONLY to indicators whose Outcome Type in Table 1 includes Code 6, 7, 8, or 11.<br>3. **Single Variable Status Check (Codes 1 & 2)**:<br>• Confirm Code 1 is assigned ONLY to non-constitutive indicators where the PVC and Indicator Topic are identical.<br>• Confirm Code 2 is assigned ONLY to non-constitutive indicators where a proxy is present.<br>• **Univariate Transformation Guardrail**: Pursuant to Section 3.2.1.1, verify that indicators representing a single variable that has been re-binned or transformed are NOT assigned Outcome Type 6, 7, 8, or 11.<br>4. **Exclusion Check (Code 1)**: Confirm Code 1 is strictly prohibited from co-occurring with any other constitutive code (Codes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).<br><br>List any discrepancies and provide the corrected Table 6 output." |
| **P26** | **PRODUCE TABLE 7** | "AI must re-read Section [16.8 Table 7 Specifications](#168-table-7-specifications) and then produce Table 7 using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1. In producing Table 7, the AI must also follow general instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes)." |
| **P27** | **TABLE 7 CONSISTENCY AND EVALUATION VALIDATION** | "**Mandate 1 (No Inference Rule)**: Audit Table 7 to confirm every entry in the **Community Type, Unit of Observation, Unit of Analysis, Empirical vs Modeled, Primary vs Secondary, and Data Source 3** columns strictly adheres to the rule that if information is unknown, the code \"n/r\" or \"Undetermined\" is used, rather than inferring data types or scales not documented in the source text. **Mandate 2 (Evaluation Verification)**: Audit the **Indicator Action** column for all instances of Code **1 (Evaluation)**. Verify the indicator was demonstrably used in an assessment of a real-world system, as defined in section [8.0 Indicator Action](#80-indicator-action). If the sole purpose was purely theoretical, Code 1 must be removed. List any discrepancies and provide the corrected Table 7 output." |
| **P28** | **CALCULATION FLOW CHART GENERATION PROMPT** | "Based exclusively on the data in the **'Associated Sub-variable'** and **'Associated Outcome Variable'** columns, generate a complete flow chart detailing the calculated relationships. The output must adhere strictly to the following format:<br>1. **Format:** A single, pipe-delimited table suitable for Excel.<br>2. **Sectioning:** Group calculation chains logically. Use title format: **X. [Index Name] Chain (#[Index ID]).**<br>3. **Section Divider:** Use a row of `---` between sections.<br>4. **Content:** Table must contain six columns: 1. Flow Chart Section; 2. Sub-Variable (Input); 3. Status (N, S, I); 4. Conceptual Relationship Code; 5. Formulaic Link; 6. Outcome Variable.<br>**Note:** Ensure every constitutive link is represented once." |
| **P29** | **Verify Conceptual Relationship Typology** | "Verify that the conceptual relationship code populated in the calculation flow chart relied on the **Conceptual Relationship Typology (Codes 1–7)** from section [4.2 Conceptual Relationship Typology](#4.2-conceptual-relationship-typology) of the Global Instruction Preamble (GIP)." |
| **P30** | **X-Y Relationship Flow Chart Generation Prompt** | "Create a similar flow chart for relating variables to target variables, with the following specifications:<br><br>1. **Status (N, S, I)**: Use the correct code from the Inclusion Justification for the status of the Relating Variable (X). (Rationale: Ensures consistency in detailing origin).<br>2. **X-Y Relationship Code**: The Conceptual Code column must use the **X-Y Relationship Type Code (1-9)**, not the Constitutive Link Code (3, 4, 5). (Rationale: Clarifies distinction between causal (X-Y) and mathematical (Constitutive) one)." |
| **P31** | **Verify X-Y Relationship Typology** | "Verify that the X-Y relationship flow chart relied on the **Predictive X-Y relationship codes (Codes 1–9)** from section [14.3.2 X-Y Relationships to Record](#1432-x-y-relationships-to-record) of the Global Instruction Preamble (GIP)." |
| **P32** | **PRODUCE TABLE 8** | "AI must re-read Section [16.9 Table 8 Specifications (Conceptual Topic and Feedback)](#169-table-8-specifications-conceptual-topic-and-feedback) and then produce Table 8 using the same list of indicators in the same order as Table 1. In producing Table 8, the AI must also follow general instruction in Section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes)." |
| **P33** | **GLOBAL TABLE OUTPUT FINALIZATION AUDIT** | "The AI must perform a **Global Table Output Finalization Audit** on Tables 1 through 8 to ensure compliance with the **Rules for All Tables** in section [16.0 Instructions for Producing Tables of Indicators and their Attributes](#160-instructions-for-producing-tables-of-indicators-and-their-attributes). Specifically: **1. Structural Integrity Check:** Verify correct column structure and pipe alignment. **2. Placeholder Compliance Check:** Verify every rationale/feedback cell is populated with substantive text or the placeholder **\"n/a\"**, ensuring no blank cells exist. List location errors found and provide a statement confirming compliance." |
| **P34** | **PRODUCE RATIONALE AND ANALYTICAL ROLE MAPPING** | "The AI must produce a final 'Indicator Rationale and Analytical Role Mapping' table for all indicators. 1. **Ordering & Grouping**: Indicators must be listed in the exact same numerical order as Table 1; within that sequence, identify their position in the constitutive hierarchy (e.g., Final Outcomes, Sub-Aggregates, Constitutive Inputs, Empirical Anchors, and Predictive Relaters). 2. **Columns**: Include Indicator #, Name, Inclusion Justification (Code/Text), Analytical Role, and a Rationale for Inclusion & Role in the Analysis. 3. **AI Note Mandate**: Every rationale entry MUST begin with the prefix **'AI note: '**. 4. **Content**: Explain the 'why' (GIP mandate) and the 'how' (specific role in the study's mathematical or causal logic). 5. **Validation**: Ensure every indicator from Table 1 is represented consistently." |
